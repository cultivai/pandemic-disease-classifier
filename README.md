## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Pandemic is a project that aims to indentify if a leave is healthy or not through a single picture of it. To do so, we're using convolutional neural networks and the dataset from [PlantVillage](https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset).

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have all of the Python dependencies already installed, including Jupyter and TensorFlow, along with the dataset from PlantVillage. You can either `git clone` it or use `svn` to download only the important folders since the repository is way too large, like so:

```bash
svn checkout https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset/trunk/raw/color/Grape___Esca_\(Black_Measles)
```

### Installing

First of all, install all of the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then create a `dataset` folder containing two subfolders, those 2 will be the classes that you want to classify later one. In the end, you should have a folder structure like so:

```
src
├── balance_data.py
├── cnn.ipynb
├── dataset
│   ├── bad
│   └── healthy
├── load_dataset.py
├── predict.py
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

In case your dataset is imbalanced (way more data from one class than the other), you can try to augment your data with the `balance_data.py` script. Change the folder that you want it to work on, then run:

```bash
python balance_data.py
```

Then you can start your Jupyter server with `jupyter notebook` inside our work folder, open the `cnn.ipynb` notebook and start to work on it.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

If you want to try out a model generated by our previous notebook, you can do so by simply running the `predict.py` script with the appropriate `h5` model. Be aware that the input image needs to be of size 256x256 pixels. A simple way to scale all images, which is commented inside `predict.py` is:

```python
size = 256, 256

# change this to your actual path
path = "test"
num = 0

for item in os.listdir(path):
    file = os.path.join(path, item)
    im = Image.open(file)
    im = im.resize(size)
    im.save(os.path.join(path, (str(num) + ".jpg")))
    num += 1
    os.remove(file)
```
